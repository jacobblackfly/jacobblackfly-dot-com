Few artists can claim that their debut single is about cake. Jacob Blackfly can, though that doesn’t mean 
desserts are the only thing he talks about in his self-produced indie-pop songs. 
Originally from Brussels and currently living in Helsinki, Jacob Blackfly grew up surrounded by a mix of 
2000s and 2010s pop, classical music and classic rock and blues, before later discovering electronic 
music and RnB. These genres have shaped Jacob Blackfly’s sound to range from piano ballads infused 
with electronic elements, through pop-rock to 90s-style hip hop, but with a consistent focus on catchy 
melodies and memorable grooves.

<br></br>
With influences ranging from Adele and Corinne Bailey Rae through AC/DC and The Beatles to Rufus Du Sol 
and Calvin Harris, Jacob’s simple and to-the-point lyrics about topics such as relationships, food and 
man’s search for meaning are underpinned by a playful approach to life and combine with the unusual harmony 
of his tracks to form a catchy yet intriguing listening experience.

Encouraged from a young age by his parents to pursue a musical hobby, Jacob undertook eight years of 
classical piano and music theory training, which enabled him to start writing his own music upon reaching 
university to study Economics. Performances of classical works as member of various choirs including the 
<a href="https://bfc.org.uk/" target="_blank" className="linkinsidetext"> Brighton Festival Chorus</a> and 
<a href="https://solkuoro.fi/" target="_blank" className="linkinsidetext"> Savolaisen Osakunnan Laulajat </a>
developed Jacob as a singer and performer. After working as a software engineer for 3 years 
Jacob quit his job to be able to devote more time to music, getting accepted to the music 
program at Laajasalon Opisto.

Jacob’s most recent projects include 2 single releases, “180 Degrees” and “Searching”, the former reaching 
1000 streams on Youtube. Currently Jacob is in the studio working on his debut EP, due out in June 2025, 
which will feature an additional 3 songs. Jacob is also co-writing and producing a single “Leikitään” 
with Kultapoiki, due to come out late 2025. Lastly, Jacob is actively gigging in Helsinki performing 
his own music (most recently at four Aitoklubi events at Ylistalo and at Playhouse Bar) and as a band 
member in other musicians’ projects, including being part of the house band for a kaupunki.tv livestream 
in November 2024. Kallio Block Party and Herttoniemi Block Party founder, member of Kontula Electronic 
working group Mikko Heinänen comments on Jacob’s music (Feb 2025): “Jacob has a clearly distinctive 
voice in his songs.”
